# 📊 Customer Behavior & Statistical Sales Analysis

## 📖 The Story
In this project, I acted as a Data Analyst to transform raw sales data into strategic insights. Beyond basic reporting, I applied **statistical analysis** to understand the distribution of customer spending, helping the business identify not just *what* happened, but the *patterns* behind the numbers.

## 🛠️ What I Did
1.  **Statistical Analysis:** 
    *   Applied **Normal Distribution (Bell Curve)** analysis to identify spending patterns.
    *   Calculated the **Top 10% of Purchases** (starting from $443.63) to isolate high-value transactions.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** 
    *   Handled data formatting and ensured integrity by removing duplicates and null values.
3.  **Data Processing:** 
    *   Utilized **Pivot Tables** and advanced formulas to aggregate KPIs like Total Amount, Min/Max, and Averages.
4.  **Interactive Visualization:** 
    *   Built a dynamic dashboard with **Slicers** for real-time data exploration across demographics.

## 💡 Key Insights
*   **Spending Distribution:** The statistical bell curve reveals that the majority of purchases are concentrated around the average, while the top 10% of "Star" customers significantly drive revenue.
*   **Demographics:** The 38-47 age group is the most active (30.50%), and Married customers lead in total spending ($70,981).
*   **Efficiency Metrics:** Maintained an Average Order Value (Avg Amount) of $275.06 across 1,000 transactions.
